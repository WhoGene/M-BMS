# M-BMS
Modular BMS High Level Control Logic

# Time per battery load current a5.lisp
It's a battery load testing utitity ideal for:
;  - checking varous configurations aginst each other
;  - validating power delivery
;  - determining relationship between loaded and unloaded voltages under amp load
;  - cell health checkup as it ages

It should output the following after you upload it:
### "test time"
2.359900f32
# "end phase current"
68.875969f32
# "start voltage"
3.423788f32
# "end voltage"
3.227900f32
# "v-sag"
